# 🎨 Assets Library – Coding Challenge

A React + TypeScript + Vite application for managing and organizing media assets such as images, audio, and video. This app provides a clean and modern UI to drag-and-drop, upload, filter, and manage assets across two zones: **Source** and **Target**.

## ✨ Features

- 📁 **Drag & Drop Files from Desktop**: Drop images, audios, or videos directly into either zone.
- ➕ **Add via Modal**: Use the plus (+) button to upload media with a file picker.
- 📤 **Drag Between Zones**: Move assets between "Source" and "Target" using internal drag-and-drop.
- 🎛 **Filtering by Type**: Show only images, audios, or videos using a dropdown filter per zone.
- 🧹 **Delete Assets**: Remove any asset with the delete button.
- 💾 **Persistence**: All assets are saved in `localStorage` using React Context API — your data stays even after refresh.
- 🧠 **Global State**: Asset state is shared and managed with React Context API.
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Zones are horizontally scrollable on smaller screens for a mobile-friendly layout.
- 🎨 **Modern Design**: Styled with TailwindCSS + Material Symbols icons.
